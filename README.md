Must have:

- Loading icon for the videos.

Nice to have:
- Preserve the state of the different hotfires.
- Add the luna hotfires.
    - Add different sections for different vehicles.
- Change the thrust for hotfire three to the one that's better. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YPNvGyRxLNO_Y38eYAh70m6hxMvxNFnK/edit#gid=1427090460
- Hotfire 0 has a pressure curve that goes negative. That at least deserves an acknowledgement.
- See if there is a properly zeroed thrust curve for hotfire 2.
- Do an analysis for combustion instability.
    - In particular during the second half of hotfire 2.
