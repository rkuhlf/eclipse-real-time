TODO: 

- Polish up descriptions.
- Tapping the playback bar should pause. It should also go to that place in the video.
- Bug where changing playback rate while playing causes elapsed time to get desynced. Should update elapsed time at the moment of the change.
- Add feature to fix the first frame of the video and the last frame so that we can go until the end of a timer, when the video is prevented from playing any further.
- Fix issue with inability to scroll past the description window.
- Tapping the spacebar should always pause, not activate the selected element.
- Add the flight.
- Finish the tables
- You should be able to click on the graph to go to that spot.
- Cursor should change to pan while panning.

Nice to have:
- Preserve the state of the different hotfires.
- Add the luna hotfires.
    - Add different sections for different vehicles.
- Change the thrust for hotfire three to the one that's better. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YPNvGyRxLNO_Y38eYAh70m6hxMvxNFnK/edit#gid=1427090460
- Hotfire 0 has a pressure curve that goes negative. That at least deserves an acknowledgement.
- See if there is a properly zeroed thrust curve for hotfire 2.
- Do an analysis for combustion instability.
    - In particular during the second half of hotfire 2.
