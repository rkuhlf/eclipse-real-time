TODO: Work with the controls / CSS for zooming and panning the video. There should be a min zoom and a max zoom, and a min pan and a max pan. It shouldn't overflow, and it shouldn't be too sensitive.


Bug where changing playback rate while playing causes elapsed time to get desynced. Should update elapsed time at the moment of the chagne.
